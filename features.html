            <h3 id="content-heading">Real-Time Recognition</h3>
            <p> High-Speed Processing: The system utilizes the YOLOv5 model's efficient architecture to process video frames in real-time, ensuring prompt detection of traffic signs without significant delays.
                Low Latency: By leveraging optimized algorithms and hardware acceleration (such as GPUs or specialized neural processing units), the system minimizes latency between capturing video frames and displaying detection results, enabling instantaneous feedback to the driver.
                Continuous Monitoring: The system continuously scans the environment for traffic signs, allowing it to adapt quickly to changes in road conditions and provide up-to-date information to the driver.

        <div class="feature">
            <h3>Alert System</h3>
            <p> Visual Alerts: When a traffic sign is detected, the system overlays a visual indicator on the vehicle's dashboard or heads-up display, drawing the driver's attention to the detected sign. The indicator typically includes the type of sign (e.g., speed limit, stop sign) and any relevant information (e.g., numerical speed limit).
                Auditory Alerts: In addition to visual cues, the system can generate auditory alerts, such as beeps or spoken messages, to further notify the driver of important road signs or warnings. Auditory alerts are especially useful in situations where the driver's visual attention may be compromised.
                Customizable Thresholds: The alert system can be configured to trigger alerts based on predefined thresholds, such as exceeding the speed limit or approaching a stop sign at high speed. This customization ensures that alerts are tailored to the driver's preferences and driving habits.
                Multilingual Support: To accommodate drivers from diverse linguistic backgrounds, the alert system can provide alerts in multiple languages, either through text or speech synthesis.
                By combining real-time recognition capabilities with an effective alert system, the traffic sign detection system enhances driver awareness of road signs, promotes adherence to traffic regulations, and contributes to overall road safety..</p>
